# Machine Learning Project by Skerdi Velo

This project uses neural networks and machine learning techniques to teach a car how to avoid collisions with other cars and not to leave the road.

## Introduction

The project was developed by Skerdi Velo. The main goal is to use machine learning and neural networks to create a model that can teach a car how to navigate safely. This was done with pure JavaScript and no external libraries.

## Technologies Used

-   JavaScript
-   Neural Networks
-   Machine Learning

## How It Works

The machine learning model takes input data from the car's sensors and uses this information to make predictions on how the car should move to avoid collisions and stay on the road.
